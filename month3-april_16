everyone or some people had arduino, some people were still waiting for theirs to come in the mail like me. But this month
was mostly learning the ins and outs of arduino if anything i've learn it was mostly arduino related, the only problem was that 
the assignments need an image of the code so problem i dont have a camera that i can use on me, my phone is a brick, everyone
i know calls it an obama phone, and not beacause its black. with that i had to ask people to take a picture, and it was
making me mad, but things only got good at the end of the month, were we and i mean me and shawn had to make another game
one with "5 output states." and uses python that communcates with the arduino by that i thought of a way to do that, 
i got the idea from bop-it a wario-ware. so shawn agreed and we got started, we needed 5 outputs states, so we made 
5 mini-games that uses outputs that we already know, so it would be easier on ourselves, and so we got to work.
