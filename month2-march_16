after many problems just to list a few

1. problems making a 2d grid in python
2. issues with the battle function
3. we didnt have a story
4. we feared that we bit into something to big for us

we were thinking if we made each a simple polygon i.e. a 3x3 square it would be easier to program, did not work
i could not get it to work, i could go 1 way indifintly, so it was a bust. with that we want with a simpler idea
we made it a 1 way route and use that with our game time was short but we split the work shawn did to coding because
he had a laptop and the code with him, and i took care of the story, which was mostly just taken from dante's inferno.
at the middle of the month we manage to get it done on time working, people seemed to enjoy it, even if it was linear,
but it was not bad at all. the month ended with the start to learn arduino.
