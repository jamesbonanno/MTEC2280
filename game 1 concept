dave was a warror who died fighting for what he believed in, and now finds himself in the deepest part of hell,
were he now must travel out. you will travel from the frozen lake to limbo, to escape, but the questions is
how will people react to the warror who died fighting for what he believed in?

how do you play it

every area has a boss you'll fight that boss DD style, your damage based on the roll of a dice roll lower then the boss
you take damage equal to the differance in numbers.
