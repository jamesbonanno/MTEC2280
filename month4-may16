the last month of classes some people were excited, orther nervous because of the projects and finals, we hit some problems

1. some parts we did not know how to work with them
2. recoding the first game so it works for this concept
3. python communcating with the arduino (it was not easy)
4. shawns arduino board was shot, he sorted it out on the last day

we had the project images and shown them to the class, and explain the who,what, and why. the game was a simple play with 
bop-it but instead of it have simon says on it were you must keep up the pace, we took the rpg element and worked with what
we got, we went for 5 mini-games, a temperture game, where you have to change the temperture on the LM35, a photoresistor 
for a mini-game were the player must block it for a set amount of time, a distance mini-game were we use a HC-SR04 and 
the player must guess the distance between it and the wall, and thats really all we had ready at the time, but people 
liked the idea, and if it did work people would properly enjoy it.
